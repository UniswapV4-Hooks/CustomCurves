Given inventories levels $R_X, R_Y$ for tokens $X,Y$ and a terms of trade space $\mathbb{P}^{(X,Y)}$, We want to define a measure $\mathcal{L}$ over $\mathbb{P}^{(X,Y)}$ that a high-level tells us the trading volume at each terms of trade $\mathbb{P}^{(X,Y)}$. Then we want at $P_i \in \mathbb{P}^{(X,Y)} \implies \mathcal{L} (P_i) = v$ which means that the trading volume is to be $v$ concentrated on $P_i$.

However since $T_X, T_Y$ are complementary tokens we have fixed terms of trade, this is
$$
\min \big \{ R_X, R_Y\big\} = L
$$
